# ANSYS Mechanical Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts intended to automate common workflows in **ANSYS Mechanical** using the Mechanical scripting environment.

The scripts are designed to reduce manual setup time and improve repeatability when working with large or complex models.

## General Purpose

The scripts in this repository support tasks such as:

- Creating and managing coordinate systems
- Generating remote points from geometry or external data
- Applying loads and boundary conditions programmatically
- Automating result export (images and animations)
- Injecting APDL command snippets into analyses
- Performing parametric or swept load studies

Each script is focused on a single responsibility and can be run independently or combined as part of a larger automation workflow.

## Intended Use

- Executed inside the ANSYS Mechanical scripting console
- Used as building blocks for larger model automation

## Repository Structure

Scripts are organized by functionality to make them easy to understand, modify, and reuse.  


They are provided as a starting point and may require adjustment depending on model setup and ANSYS version.
